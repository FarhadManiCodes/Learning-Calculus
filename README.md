# Learning-Calculus
## Repsoitor for the notes I take for reviewing,learning and teaching Calculus
In the first part I will go through the first book of Apostol on calculus:
Apostol, Tom M. Calculus, Volume 1: [One-Variable Calculus, with An Introduction to Linear Algebra](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Calculus%2C+Volume+1%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780471000051) ISBN: 978-0-471-00005-1

I will review the books and exercises and add my own insights to it.
